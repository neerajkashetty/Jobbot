Based on the provided input, structure the resume into sections such as Summary, Education, Experience, Skills, Certifications, and Personal Details.

  3. Provide the **description** for each job as bullet points, with at least **5 key points**. Highlight specific responsibilities, achievements, and skills relevant to the new job description provided above. Use metrics or outcomes wherever applicable.
  4. Ensure the **Skills** section lists only the keywords from the job description and excludes unrelated terms.
